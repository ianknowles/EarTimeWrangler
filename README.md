Tabular Document Wrangler. The code parses data from several types of poorly formatted tabular data formats, including pdf and csv files â€“ on ministerial meetings between ministers and lobbyists. It forms a central part of **'Ear-time with the Cabinet: Ministerial meetings as vehicles for lobbying'**, which is a joint collaboration between the University of Oxford and Transparency International UK.

### Prerequisites
As a pre-requisite to running [wrangler.py](https://github.com/crahal/EarTimeWrangler/blob/master/src/wrangler.py), you might consider setting up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) with an installation of `pdfminer3k`. An install of Python 3.6 or greater is required.
`pdfminer3k` can be installed with the command `pip install 'pdfminer3k'`, a full tutorial can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).

### Running the Code

Download a [zip](https://github.com/ianknowles/EarTimeWrangler/archive/master.zip) of this repository or `git clone https://github.com/ianknowles/EarTimeWrangler` this repository and run `python wrangler.py` from the `src` folder at the command line.

### Input/output file folders

The script looks for input files in the `data` folder, with subfolders expected to match the government department code.
The SQLite database and csv exports will be placed in the `output` folder.
